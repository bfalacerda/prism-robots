6doors_prod.prism is the trimmed product obtained for the MDP where doors might be closed and for property ((!"WayPoint22") U "WayPoint1")  & ((!"WayPoint22") U "WayPoint21"). Property 1 does not converge (this is the old bug, it converges when using -lp and yields the policy I have drawn and make me realise that the probabilistic policies might not be the way to go). Property 2 converges, and generates  a Pareto curve where the time minimisation is attained by driving the robot to "WayPoint22" instead of visiting the rooms.

6doors_prod_prob1.prism is the trimmed product for the MDP where doors are always open, and for property ((!"WayPoint22") U "WayPoint1")  & ((!"WayPoint22") U "WayPoint21"). Both properties converge, however again for property 2 the robot is driven towards "WayPoint22" instead of visiting the rooms.

6doors_prod_prob1_F.prism is the trimmed product for the MDP where the doors are always open, and for property ((F "WayPoint1")  & (F "WayPoint21")).  In this case the solution will always have to visit the 2 waypoints. Both properties fail. Property 1 fails to converge in the 3rd value iteration call, property 2 in the 1st value iteration call.
